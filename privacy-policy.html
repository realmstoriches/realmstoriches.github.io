            <p>Effective Date: [Add Current Date, e.g., June 10, 2024]</p>

            <p>Realms to Riches ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you visit our website located at https://realmstoriches.github.io/ (the "Site"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Site.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in various ways:</p>

            <h3>Personal Information</h3>
            <p>We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your email address, when you sign up for our mailing list via the popup form. We may also collect other information you provide if you contact us directly (e.g., name, phone number if you call or email).</p>

            <h3>Usage Data and Cookies</h3>
            <p>We may automatically collect certain information when you access the Site. This may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, access times, and the pages you have viewed directly before and after accessing the Site. We may also collect information about your interaction with the Site, such as the links clicked.</p>
            <p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like local storage for the cookie consent banner and popup suppression) to collect this information. Cookies are small data files stored on your device. They help us understand how the Site is used, remember your preferences (like your cookie consent choice), and potentially improve your experience. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</p>
            <p>Our cookie popup uses your browser's local storage to remember your preference. We do not use third-party cookies for tracking unless you enable analytics.</p>
             <!-- Add this section if you plan to add analytics -->
             <!--
             <p>[Optional: If you add Google Analytics or similar:] We use [e.g., Google Analytics] to collect information about site usage.

We use the information we get from [Google Analytics] only to improve this Site. [Google Analytics] collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this Site, rather than your name or other identifying information.
